# Sprint Retrospective - Foundation Merge Sprint
*Date: 2025-08-25*

## What Actually Got Done ‚úÖ

### Major Achievements
1. **Foundation Merge Completed** - Successfully consolidated accumulated work
2. **Scrum Framework Established** - Complete development workflow documented
3. **Mycelium Architecture** - Transport-adaptive messaging system documented
4. **Pool Cache Integration** - Real pool discovery with parallel RPC calls
5. **Documentation Overhaul** - Comprehensive guides and roadmap updates

### Technical Completions
- ‚úÖ Pool cache infrastructure with Web3 connection pooling
- ‚úÖ Parallel RPC calls for token metadata and pool type detection
- ‚úÖ TLV message construction and parsing framework
- ‚úÖ Performance benchmarking tools and analysis
- ‚úÖ Atomic development workflow with git enforcement
- ‚úÖ Test-driven development templates and validation scripts

## What Didn't Get Done ‚ùå

### Critical Production Blockers (Still Pending)
- ‚ùå **PRECISION-001** - Signal precision loss (f64 ‚Üí UsdFixedPoint8) not actually implemented
- ‚ùå **EXECUTION-001** - Arbitrage execution path still incomplete
- ‚ùå **RISK-001** - No position sizing or risk management
- ‚ùå **MONITORING-001** - No production monitoring implemented

### System Issues Discovered
- ‚ùå **Build Conflicts** - Binary name collisions (execution_relay, market_data_relay)
- ‚ùå **Git Workflow Problem** - Shared terminal state confused branch switching
- ‚ùå **Task Completion Claims** - Roadmap marked things complete that weren't actually done

## Root Cause Analysis

### Git Workflow Issue
**Problem**: `git checkout` in one terminal affects ALL terminals in the session
**Impact**: Broke atomic development workflow, confused task assignment
**Solution Needed**: Document git worktree usage for parallel development

### Over-Optimistic Task Marking
**Problem**: Tasks marked as complete in roadmap when only foundation work was done
**Impact**: False sense of progress, unclear what actually needs implementation
**Solution**: More conservative task completion criteria

### Build System Issues
**Problem**: Duplicate binary names causing warnings and potential conflicts
**Impact**: Unclear deployment story, build warnings reducing confidence
**Solution**: Rename binaries to avoid collisions

## Key Learnings

### What Worked Well üéØ
1. **Foundation Approach** - Getting clean baseline was valuable
2. **Documentation** - Comprehensive framework documentation will help future work
3. **Architecture Planning** - Mycelium design is solid foundation
4. **Process Documentation** - TDD templates and atomic development guides are useful

### What Needs Improvement üîß
1. **Task Granularity** - Need clearer definition of "done"
2. **Build Validation** - Should verify builds succeed before claiming completion
3. **Git Workflow** - Need better branch isolation strategy
4. **Progress Tracking** - More honest assessment of actual vs. claimed progress

## Action Items for Next Sprint

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Fix Build Issues** - Resolve binary name collisions
2. **Honest Task Assessment** - Update roadmap with actual completion status
3. **Git Worktree Setup** - Document solution for shared terminal state
4. **Focus on One Real Task** - Pick PRECISION-001 and actually complete it end-to-end

### Process Improvements
1. **Definition of Done** - Task not complete until:
   - ‚úÖ Code implemented AND tested
   - ‚úÖ Build succeeds with no warnings
   - ‚úÖ PR merged to main
   - ‚úÖ System demonstrably works better
2. **Branch Isolation** - Use git worktrees for parallel development
3. **Conservative Marking** - Don't mark tasks complete until fully validated

## Current Actual Status

### What's Really Working
- ‚úÖ Basic pipeline: Exchange ‚Üí Collector ‚Üí Relay ‚Üí Dashboard
- ‚úÖ TLV message format and parsing
- ‚úÖ Pool cache foundation (but not production-validated)
- ‚úÖ Development workflow documentation

### What Needs Real Work
- üî¥ **Signal Precision** - Still using f64, losing precision in calculations
- üî¥ **Execution Logic** - Arbitrage strategy signals but doesn't execute
- üî¥ **Risk Management** - No position sizing or capital controls
- üî¥ **Production Monitoring** - No alerting or P&L tracking
- üî¥ **Build System** - Binary conflicts and warnings

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Pick ONE task**: PRECISION-001 (signal precision fix)
2. **Work in isolation**: Use git worktree for clean development
3. **Follow TDD strictly**: Test first, implement second, validate third
4. **Don't claim complete** until demonstrably working in production context
5. **Fix build warnings** as prerequisite to any new work

## Sprint Velocity Assessment

**Planned**: 8 production blocker tasks
**Actually Completed**: 0 production blocker tasks (foundation work only)
**Velocity**: Foundation sprint - not comparable to feature development

**Recommendation**: Next sprint should be conservative, focus on completing ONE task properly rather than claiming progress on many.

*This retrospective reflects honest assessment of actual progress vs. claims. Foundation work was valuable but production blockers remain unaddressed.*
