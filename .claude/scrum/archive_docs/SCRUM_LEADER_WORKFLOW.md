# Scrum Leader Workflow & Responsibilities

## 🎯 Primary Role: Task Decomposition & Orchestration

As Scrum Leader, I transform high-level requirements into executable, atomic tasks that multiple agents can work on in parallel without conflicts.

## 📋 Task Breakdown Process

### 1. Requirement Analysis
When you provide a requirement or problem:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Requirement] --> B[Analyze Complexity]
    B --> C{Size Estimate}
    C -->|>1 day| D[Decompose into Sub-tasks]
    C -->|<4 hours| E[Single Task]
    D --> F[Identify Dependencies]
    F --> G[Create Task Files]
    E --> G
    G --> H[Assign Branches]
    H --> I[Generate Sprint Plan]
```

### 2. Task Sizing Guidelines

**Atomic Task Criteria**:
- **Duration**: 1-4 hours of focused work
- **Scope**: Single responsibility
- **Output**: One PR addressing one concern
- **Testing**: Can be tested independently

**Task Size Examples**:
- ✅ "Add rate limiting to one endpoint" (2-3 hours)
- ✅ "Fix precision loss in one calculation" (1-2 hours)
- ❌ "Refactor entire authentication system" (Too large - decompose)
- ❌ "Fix typo in comment" (Too small - batch with related fixes)

### 3. Dependency Mapping

```yaml
Task Dependency Types:
  NONE:
    - Can start immediately
    - Parallel execution possible

  SEQUENTIAL:
    - Must wait for predecessor
    - Clear handoff points

  SHARED_INTERFACE:
    - Can start in parallel
    - Must agree on contracts

  INTEGRATION:
    - All predecessors must complete
    - Final assembly task
```

## 🗂️ Sprint Organization Structure

### Standard Sprint Creation
```bash
.claude/sprints/2025-01-[EPIC-NAME]/
├── SPRINT_PLAN.md           # Overview & goals
├── DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md      # Task relationships
├── tasks/
│   ├── TASK-001_[description].md
│   ├── TASK-002_[description].md
│   └── TASK-003_[description].md
├── STATUS.md                # Live tracking
└── RETROSPECTIVE.md         # Post-sprint analysis
```

### Task ID Convention
```
[COMPONENT]-[NUMBER]_[description]

Examples:
POOL-001_cache_integration
PERF-002_sampling_implementation
TEST-003_validation_suite
```

### Branch Naming Convention
```
[type]/[component]-[description]

Types:
- fix/     (bug fixes)
- feat/    (new features)
- perf/    (performance)
- refactor/ (code improvement)
- test/    (test additions)

Examples:
fix/pool-cache-integration
feat/dashboard-rate-limiting
perf/checksum-sampling
```

## 📊 Task Assignment Matrix

When creating tasks, I generate:

```markdown
| Task ID | Branch | Agent Type | Dependencies | Priority | Hours | TDD |
|---------|--------|------------|--------------|----------|-------|-----|
| POOL-001 | fix/cache | Integration | None | 🔴 High | 3 | ✅ |
| POOL-002 | fix/event | Parser | None | 🔴 High | 2 | ✅ |
| POOL-003 | fix/discovery | Async | POOL-001 | 🔴 High | 4 | ✅ |
| TEST-001 | test/integration | QA | ALL | 🟢 Low | 2 | ✅ |
```

### Test-First Task Creation Process

Every task MUST include:

1. **Test Specification Section** - Exact tests agents must write first
2. **TDD Workflow Steps** - Red → Green → Refactor cycle instructions
3. **Real Data Test Requirements** - Production validation specifications
4. **Performance Test Criteria** - Measurable performance targets
5. **TDD Validation Commands** - Scripts to verify test-first approach

## 🎭 Agent Specialization Matching

### Agent Types & Task Matching
```yaml
Integration Specialist:
  - API integrations
  - Service connections
  - Cache implementations

Performance Specialist:
  - Hot path optimization
  - Memory management
  - Benchmark improvements

Parser Specialist:
  - Event decoding
  - Protocol parsing
  - Data extraction

Async Specialist:
  - Queue implementations
  - Background workers
  - Non-blocking operations

Precision Specialist:
  - Numerical accuracy
  - Financial calculations
  - Integer arithmetic

Test Engineer:
  - Test suites
  - Validation
  - Integration tests
```

## 🔄 Sprint Lifecycle Management

### Phase 1: Planning (Day 0)
```bash
# I create:
1. Sprint plan with goals
2. Task breakdowns
3. Dependency graph
4. Assignment matrix
```

### Phase 2: Execution (Days 1-3)
```bash
# I monitor:
1. Branch creation compliance
2. PR creation progress
3. Blocking issues
4. Integration points
```

### Phase 3: Integration (Day 4)
```bash
# I coordinate:
1. Merge order based on dependencies
2. Conflict resolution
3. Integration testing
4. Performance validation
```

### Phase 4: Retrospective (Day 5)
```bash
# I analyze:
1. Velocity metrics
2. Bottlenecks
3. Quality issues
4. Process improvements
```

## 📈 Progress Tracking

### Real-time STATUS.md Updates
```markdown
# Sprint Status: 2025-01-CRITICAL-FIXES
*Updated: Every 2 hours*

## 🚀 Progress Overview
- Sprint Velocity: 8/12 tasks complete
- PRs Open: 3
- PRs Merged: 8
- Blockers: 1

## 📊 Task Status
| Task | Branch | PR | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|----|---------| ------|
| POOL-001 | fix/cache | #101 | ✅ Merged | |
| POOL-002 | fix/event | #102 | 🔄 Review | Requested changes |
| POOL-003 | fix/discovery | - | 🚧 In Progress | Blocked on POOL-001 |

## ⚠️ Attention Required
- POOL-002: Needs error handling fix
- PERF-001: Performance regression detected
```

## 🚨 Escalation Triggers

I escalate to you when:
1. **Branch Protection Violated**: Agent commits to main
2. **Task Blocked**: Dependencies not met
3. **Scope Creep**: Agent exceeding task boundaries
4. **Performance Regression**: Benchmarks failing
5. **Integration Failure**: PRs conflict significantly

## 📝 Task File Template

Every task I create includes:

```markdown
# Task [ID]: [Clear Description]
*Branch: `[exact-branch-name]`*
*Estimated: [1-4] hours*
*Agent Type: [Specialist Role]*
