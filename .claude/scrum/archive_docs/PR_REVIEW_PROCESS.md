# Pull Request Review Process

## 🎯 PR Review Framework

This document defines our standard process for reviewing agent-created pull requests to ensure quality and compliance.

## ✅ PR #1 Compliance Analysis

### 🔒 Git Workflow Compliance: EXCELLENT ✅
- ✅ Correct branch: `fix/pool-cache-integration`
- ✅ No commits to main
- ✅ Single focused commit
- ✅ Proper commit message format: `feat(pool): [description]`
- ✅ Branch matches task assignment

### 📋 PR Format Compliance: EXCELLENT ✅
- ✅ Follows our PR template structure
- ✅ Includes Task ID: POOL-001
- ✅ Specifies branch name
- ✅ Clear summary of changes
- ✅ Lists specific files modified
- ✅ Includes testing section
- ✅ Performance impact assessment
- ✅ Complete checklist

### 🎯 Task Scope Compliance: EXCELLENT ✅
- ✅ Followed task specification exactly
- ✅ Used existing `libs/state/market/src/pool_cache.rs`
- ✅ Did NOT create new cache code
- ✅ Modified only assigned files
- ✅ Stayed within 1-4 hour scope

### 📊 Technical Quality Indicators: GOOD ⚠️
- ✅ Files modified: 2 (focused scope)
- ✅ Additions: 80 lines (reasonable)
- ✅ Deletions: 34 lines (cleanup)
- ✅ Compilation successful
- ⚠️ Testing: Only compilation check (needs more)

## 🔍 Standard PR Review Checklist

### Phase 1: Compliance Check (Scrum Leader)
```bash
# Verify branch compliance
git branch --contains [PR-COMMIT]
# Should show feature branch, NOT main

# Check commit history
git log --oneline [BRANCH] --not main
# Should show clean, focused commits

# Verify file scope
git diff --name-only main..[BRANCH]
# Should match task specification

# Check for main contamination
git log main --since="[DATE]" --author="[AGENT]"
# Should be empty (no direct commits)
```

### Phase 2: Format Review (Automated)
- [ ] PR title follows format: `[type]([scope]): [description]`
- [ ] Body includes Task ID
- [ ] Branch name specified
- [ ] Summary describes changes
- [ ] Files modified listed
- [ ] **COMPREHENSIVE TESTING EVIDENCE** present
- [ ] **Unit test outputs** included (full output, all passing)
- [ ] **Integration test results** included
- [ ] **Performance benchmarks** included
- [ ] **Real data testing results** included (where applicable)
- [ ] **End-to-end validation** completed
- [ ] Performance impact measured and documented
- [ ] Real data validation metrics provided
- [ ] Mandatory checklist 100% complete

### Phase 3: Technical Pre-Review (Scrum Leader)
```bash
# Verify ALL tests actually pass by re-running
cargo test --package [MODIFIED-PACKAGE]
# MUST match PR evidence

# Verify performance benchmarks
cargo bench --baseline main [RELEVANT-BENCHMARKS]
# MUST show no regression

# For trading components: Verify real data capability
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --bin [COMPONENT] -- --test-mode --duration=30s
# MUST process real market data successfully

# Integration test validation
cargo test --package [MODIFIED-PACKAGE] --test integration
# MUST pass all scenarios
```

### Phase 3.5: Test-First Development Validation (MANDATORY)
**PR CANNOT proceed without:**
- [ ] **Red Phase Evidence**: Failing tests committed first (proves TDD)
- [ ] **Green Phase Evidence**: Same tests now pass after implementation
- [ ] **Refactor Phase Evidence**: Tests remain green after optimization
- [ ] Unit test output shows `test result: ok. 0 failed`
- [ ] Integration tests demonstrate real system interaction
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show stable/improved metrics
- [ ] Real data testing proves production viability
- [ ] End-to-end validation confirms complete workflow
- [ ] All test outputs are recent (within 24 hours)
- [ ] No test skips or ignores without justification
- [ ] **Commit history shows TDD workflow** (tests → implementation → refactor)

### Phase 4: Code Review Assignment (You)
If Phases 1-3 pass, assign to specialist reviewer:
- **Integration Tasks** → Integration Specialist Agent
- **Performance Tasks** → Performance Specialist Agent
- **Protocol Tasks** → Protocol Specialist Agent

## 🎯 PR #1 Review Summary

### Compliance Score: 95/100
- Git Workflow: 100/100 ✅
- PR Format: 100/100 ✅
- Task Scope: 100/100 ✅
- Technical Quality: 75/100 ⚠️

### Strengths
1. **Perfect git hygiene** - Agent followed branch rules exactly
2. **Excellent PR format** - Used our template properly
3. **Scope adherence** - Did exactly what was asked
4. **Integration approach** - Used existing code vs creating new

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Testing depth** - Only compilation, needs runtime tests
2. **Dependency verification** - Should confirm pool_cache dependency works
3. **Error handling** - Need to verify graceful failure modes

### Recommendation: APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS

**Conditions before merge:**
1. Add integration test showing cache actually works
2. Verify dependency on `torq-state-market` is properly declared
3. Test with actual RPC endpoint to confirm discovery works

## 📋 Approval Workflow

### Step 1: Scrum Leader Pre-Approval (Me)
```markdown
**Compliance Review: PASSED ✅**
- Git workflow: Compliant
- PR format: Excellent
- Task scope: Within bounds
- Ready for technical review

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Add integration test
2. Verify RPC dependency
3. Test discovery mechanism
```

### Step 2: Technical Review (Specialist Agent)
Assign to Integration Specialist for detailed code review:
```
"Review PR #1 for technical correctness. Focus on:
1. Pool cache integration implementation
2. Error handling completeness
3. Performance impact validation
4. Integration test adequacy"
```

### Step 3: Final Approval (You)
After technical review passes:
```bash
gh pr review 1 --approve --body "Approved after compliance and technical review"
gh pr merge 1 --squash --delete-branch
```

### Step 4: Post-Merge Validation
```bash
# Update sprint status
# Run integration tests
# Monitor performance metrics
# Update roadmap progress
```

## 🚨 Red Flags (Auto-Reject)

Immediately reject PRs with:
- ❌ Commits to main branch
- ❌ Wrong branch name
- ❌ Files outside task scope
- ❌ Missing PR template sections
- ❌ **Missing comprehensive testing evidence**
- ❌ **Failed unit/integration tests**
- ❌ **No real data testing** (for trading/market components)
- ❌ **Performance regressions >5%**
- ❌ Compilation failures or warnings
- ❌ Test outputs older than 24 hours
- ❌ Mock-only testing for production components

## 🧪 Testing Validation Script

Use this to verify PR testing claims:
```bash
./.claude/scrum/test_validation_template.sh [COMPONENT] [PACKAGE] [PR_NUMBER]
```

This script automatically validates:
- Unit tests pass
- Integration tests pass
- Performance benchmarks stable
- Real data processing (where applicable)
- Compilation and linting clean

## 📊 Process Metrics

Track these for continuous improvement:
- **Compliance Rate**: % of PRs passing Phase 1
- **First-Pass Approval**: % approved without revision
- **Review Cycle Time**: Hours from PR to merge
- **Revision Rate**: Average revisions per PR
- **Quality Score**: Post-merge issue frequency
