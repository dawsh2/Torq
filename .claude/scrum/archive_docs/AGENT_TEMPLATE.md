# üîí MANDATORY AGENT INSTRUCTIONS - ENFORCEMENT TEMPLATE

## ‚õî CRITICAL: BRANCH ENFORCEMENT

**YOU ARE STRICTLY FORBIDDEN FROM WORKING ON THE MAIN BRANCH**

### MANDATORY FIRST COMMANDS (COPY AND RUN):
```bash
# CHECK 1: Verify you're NOT on main
git branch --show-current

# If the output is "main", you MUST run:
git checkout -b [YOUR-ASSIGNED-BRANCH]

# CHECK 2: Confirm you're on correct branch
git branch --show-current
# Output MUST show: [YOUR-ASSIGNED-BRANCH]
# If not, STOP and fix before proceeding
```

## üö´ FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

You MUST NOT:
- ‚ùå Run `git checkout main` (except to create feature branch)
- ‚ùå Run `git merge` into main
- ‚ùå Run `git push origin main`
- ‚ùå Modify any branch other than your assigned branch
- ‚ùå Create additional branches beyond your assigned one
- ‚ùå Close or merge Pull Requests

## ‚úÖ REQUIRED ACTIONS

You MUST:
- ‚úÖ Work ONLY in branch: `[YOUR-ASSIGNED-BRANCH]`
- ‚úÖ Commit ONLY to your feature branch
- ‚úÖ Push ONLY your feature branch
- ‚úÖ **PASS ALL TESTS** before creating PR
- ‚úÖ **TEST WITH REAL DATA** where applicable
- ‚úÖ Create a Pull Request with comprehensive test results
- ‚úÖ Include performance benchmarks in PR description

## üß™ MANDATORY TEST-FIRST DEVELOPMENT

### CRITICAL: Write Tests BEFORE Implementation

You MUST follow this exact sequence:

### Step 1: Write Failing Tests FIRST
```bash
# Create your tests based on acceptance criteria
cargo test --package [your-package] [new-test-name]
# MUST show: test result: FAILED (expected behavior)
```

### Step 2: Write Minimal Implementation
```bash
# Implement just enough to make tests pass
cargo test --package [your-package] [new-test-name]
# MUST show: test result: ok. 0 failed
```

### Step 3: Refactor & Optimize
```bash
# Improve implementation while keeping tests green
cargo test --package [your-package] [new-test-name]
# MUST remain: test result: ok. 0 failed
```

### Before Creating Any PR, You MUST:

1. **Unit Tests**: All tests you wrote FIRST must pass
```bash
cargo test --package [your-package] [test-name]
# MUST show: test result: ok. 0 failed
```

2. **Integration Tests**: Test with real system integration
```bash
cargo test --package [your-package] --test integration
# MUST pass all integration scenarios
```

3. **Performance Validation**: Ensure no regressions
```bash
cargo bench --package [your-package] [relevant-benchmark]
# MUST maintain performance targets
```

4. **Real Data Testing**: Use actual market data when applicable
```bash
# Example for pool/trading components:
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --bin [component] -- --test-mode --duration=30s
# MUST process real data successfully
```

5. **End-to-End Validation**: Test complete workflow
```bash
# Example full pipeline test:
./scripts/test_component_e2e.sh [your-component]
# MUST complete without errors
```

### Real Data Testing Requirements

For **trading/market components**, you MUST test with:
- ‚úÖ **Live exchange data** (limited duration: 30-60 seconds)
  - Crypto: Polygon, Binance, Coinbase, Kraken
  - TradFi: NYSE, NASDAQ, CME, ICE (via market data feeds)
  - DEX: Uniswap, SushiSwap, Curve (via RPC/WebSocket)
- ‚úÖ **Real connection protocols**
  - WebSocket streams for real-time data
  - REST API endpoints for historical/reference data
  - RPC endpoints for blockchain interactions
  - Market data feeds (FIX, binary protocols)
- ‚úÖ **Production message formats**
  - Native exchange formats (JSON, FIX, binary)
  - No synthetic/mocked message structures
  - Full message complexity including edge cases
- ‚úÖ **Actual identifiers and addresses**
  - Real instrument symbols (BTCUSD, TSLA, etc.)
  - Live contract addresses for DeFi protocols
  - Valid venue/exchange identifiers

For **protocol/parsing components**, you MUST test with:
- ‚úÖ **Real exchange message samples** from multiple venues
- ‚úÖ **Historical data replays** covering various market conditions
- ‚úÖ **Edge cases from production logs** (malformed, partial, delayed messages)
- ‚úÖ **Performance under realistic load** (1000+ messages/second)
- ‚úÖ **Cross-venue validation** ensuring format compatibility

### NO EXCEPTIONS POLICY

‚ùå **NEVER submit a PR with:**
- Failed unit tests
- Compilation warnings in production code
- Untested code paths
- Mock data only (for trading components)
- Performance regressions
- Missing integration validation

## üìã VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

**CRITICAL: Git State is Shared Across All Terminals**

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: When you switch branches, ALL terminal tabs in this project see the same branch. This means your changes affect everyone working in this repository immediately.

Before starting work:
```bash
# MANDATORY: Verify git state and create your branch
echo "=== GIT SAFETY CHECK ==="
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
echo "Current branch (visible to ALL terminals): $CURRENT_BRANCH"

if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "main" ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Good: Starting from main branch"
    echo "‚û°Ô∏è  Creating your feature branch NOW..."
    git checkout -b [YOUR-ASSIGNED-BRANCH]
    echo "‚úÖ Switched to: $(git branch --show-current)"
    echo "üåç NOTE: ALL terminals now show this branch"
elif [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "[YOUR-ASSIGNED-BRANCH]" ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Perfect: Already on your assigned branch"
else
    echo "‚ùå ERROR: You are on wrong branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"
    echo "‚ùå This affects ALL terminals!"
    echo "‚û°Ô∏è  Switch to your assigned branch:"
    echo "   git checkout [YOUR-ASSIGNED-BRANCH]"
    exit 1
fi
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è SAFETY REMINDERS - SHARED GIT STATE

**CRITICAL**: Your git actions affect ALL terminals immediately!

1. **NEVER** type `git push origin main`
2. **NEVER** switch to main unless explicitly instructed
3. **ALWAYS** verify branch before commits: `git branch --show-current`
4. **REMEMBER**: When you switch branches, ALL terminals switch too
5. **IF UNSURE** ask: "Which branch should I be on?" before any git command
6. **AFTER TASK**: Create PR and report completion - don't switch branches
7. **NO EXCEPTIONS** to these rules - mistakes affect everyone

## üö® ERROR RECOVERY

If you accidentally commit to main:
```bash
# STOP IMMEDIATELY and report:
"ERROR: I may have committed to main.
Current branch: $(git branch --show-current)
Last commit: $(git log -1 --oneline)"

# Wait for instructions to fix
```

## üìä COMPLIANCE TRACKING

Your compliance will be verified:
- Branch name matches assignment: ‚úì/‚úó
- Zero commits to main: ‚úì/‚úó
- PR created from correct branch: ‚úì/‚úó
- All work in assigned branch: ‚úì/‚úó

---

**FINAL REMINDER**: You are working on branch `[YOUR-BRANCH]`, NOT main.
Any commits to main will be rejected and must be redone.

**ACKNOWLEDGE**: Type "I confirm I will work only in branch [YOUR-BRANCH]" before starting.
