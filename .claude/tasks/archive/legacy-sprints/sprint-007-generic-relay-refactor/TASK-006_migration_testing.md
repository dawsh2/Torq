# TASK-006: Migration Testing and Deployment Preparation

**Branch**: `feat/migration-testing`  
**NEVER WORK ON MAIN**

## Git Enforcement  
```bash
# MANDATORY: Verify you're not on main before starting
if [ "$(git branch --show-current)" = "main" ]; then
    echo "❌ NEVER WORK ON MAIN BRANCH!"
    echo "Run: git worktree add -b feat/migration-testing"  
    exit 1
fi

# Create feature branch from performance-validation
git checkout feat/performance-validation  # Start from TASK-005 branch
git worktree add -b feat/migration-testing
git branch --show-current  # Should show: feat/migration-testing
```

## Problem Statement  
The Generic + Trait architecture refactoring must enable **zero-downtime migration** from the current relay implementations to the new architecture. This requires comprehensive testing of deployment scenarios, rollback procedures, and production compatibility.

**Critical Migration Requirements**:
- **Zero service interruption** during relay replacement
- **Identical client compatibility** - existing connections work unchanged
- **Rollback capability** - quick revert to original implementation if issues arise
- **Production validation** - tested with real polygon_publisher and dashboard traffic
- **Documentation** - clear deployment procedures for operations teams

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Side-by-side testing** - old and new relays work identically with same clients
- [ ] **Hot-swap validation** - relays can be replaced without client disconnection  
- [ ] **Rollback procedures** - tested and documented
- [ ] **Production simulation** - tested with full Torq component stack
- [ ] **Deployment scripts** - automated migration with safety checks
- [ ] **Monitoring integration** - health checks and metrics collection validated
- [ ] **Documentation complete** - operations runbook and troubleshooting guide

## Technical Approach

### Migration Strategy: Blue-Green Relay Deployment

**Phase 1**: Parallel Deployment
- Run new generic relays on different socket paths 
- Test with subset of traffic
- Validate identical behavior

**Phase 2**: Hot Swap  
- Stop old relay
- Start new relay on same socket path
- Verify client reconnection and data flow

**Phase 3**: Full Migration
- Deploy all three relay types
- Monitor for 24+ hours  
- Document any issues

### Test Environment Setup

```bash
# Test directory structure
tests/migration/
├── side_by_side_test.sh      # Compare old vs new simultaneously
├── hot_swap_test.sh          # Test relay replacement procedure  
├── rollback_test.sh          # Test revert to original implementation
├── production_sim_test.sh    # Full component stack testing
└── monitoring_test.sh        # Health check and metrics validation
```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Side-by-Side Compatibility Testing (1 hour)

**Validate identical behavior under identical conditions:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# tests/migration/side_by_side_test.sh

set -e

echo "🔄 Side-by-Side Relay Compatibility Test"
echo "========================================"

# Test Market Data Relay
echo "Testing Market Data Relay..."

# Start original relay on port A
/tmp/torq/market_data.sock.orig &
ORIG_PID=$!

# Start generic relay on port B  
/tmp/torq/market_data.sock.new &
NEW_PID=$!

sleep 2

# Send identical test messages to both
echo "test_message_1" | nc -U /tmp/torq/market_data.sock.orig &
echo "test_message_1" | nc -U /tmp/torq/market_data.sock.new &

# Compare outputs 
timeout 5s tcpdump -i lo -w orig_traffic.pcap &
timeout 5s tcpdump -i lo -w new_traffic.pcap &

sleep 10

# Cleanup
kill $ORIG_PID $NEW_PID

# Analyze traffic patterns
echo "Comparing network behavior..."
tcpdump -r orig_traffic.pcap > orig_analysis.txt
tcpdump -r new_traffic.pcap > new_analysis.txt

if diff -q orig_analysis.txt new_analysis.txt; then
    echo "✅ Identical network behavior confirmed"
else  
    echo "❌ Network behavior differs!"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Step 2: Hot-Swap Migration Testing (1 hour)

**Test zero-downtime relay replacement:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# tests/migration/hot_swap_test.sh

set -e

echo "🔄 Hot-Swap Migration Test"
echo "=========================="

# Start polygon_publisher (client)
cargo run --release --bin polygon_publisher &
POLYGON_PID=$!

# Start original market_data_relay
cargo run --release --bin market_data_relay_original &  
RELAY_PID=$!

sleep 5
echo "✅ Original relay established with polygon_publisher"

# Verify data flow
timeout 10s tail -f logs | grep "messages forwarded" &
MONITOR_PID=$!

# Perform hot swap
echo "🔄 Performing hot swap..."

# Stop original relay
kill $RELAY_PID
echo "⏹️ Original relay stopped"

# Immediately start new generic relay  
cargo run --release -p torq-relays --bin market_data_relay &
NEW_RELAY_PID=$!
echo "🚀 New generic relay started"

sleep 5

# Verify polygon_publisher reconnects and data flows
if timeout 30s grep -q "Connection.*established" <(tail -f logs); then
    echo "✅ Hot swap successful - client reconnected"
else
    echo "❌ Hot swap failed - client did not reconnect"
    exit 1
fi

# Cleanup
kill $POLYGON_PID $NEW_RELAY_PID $MONITOR_PID
```

### Step 3: Production Simulation Testing (0.75 hours)

**Test with full Torq component stack:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash  
# tests/migration/production_sim_test.sh

set -e

echo "🏭 Production Simulation Test"
echo "============================="

# Start full component stack with new generic relays
echo "Starting production simulation..."

# Start all three new generic relays
cargo run --release -p torq-relays --bin market_data_relay &
MARKET_RELAY_PID=$!

cargo run --release -p torq-relays --bin signal_relay &  
SIGNAL_RELAY_PID=$!

cargo run --release -p torq-relays --bin execution_relay &
EXECUTION_RELAY_PID=$!

sleep 3

# Start data producers
cargo run --release --bin polygon_publisher &
POLYGON_PID=$!

# Start data consumers  
cargo run --release -p torq-dashboard-websocket -- --port 8080 &
DASHBOARD_PID=$!

cargo run --release -p torq-strategies --bin flash_arbitrage &
STRATEGY_PID=$!

sleep 10

# Verify end-to-end data flow
echo "🔍 Verifying end-to-end data flow..."

# Check polygon → market_data_relay → dashboard
if timeout 30s curl -f http://localhost:8080/health; then
    echo "✅ Dashboard receiving data"
else
    echo "❌ Dashboard not receiving data"
    exit 1
fi

# Monitor for 60 seconds to catch any issues
echo "🕐 Monitoring for 60 seconds..."
sleep 60

# Check for any errors in logs
if grep -i "error\|panic\|failed" logs/* 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "❌ Errors detected in logs"
    exit 1
else
    echo "✅ No errors detected during production simulation"  
fi

# Cleanup
kill $MARKET_RELAY_PID $SIGNAL_RELAY_PID $EXECUTION_RELAY_PID
kill $POLYGON_PID $DASHBOARD_PID $STRATEGY_PID
```

### Step 4: Rollback Testing and Documentation (0.25 hours)

**Ensure quick revert capability:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# tests/migration/rollback_test.sh

set -e

echo "🔙 Rollback Procedure Test"
echo "========================="

# Simulate rollback scenario
echo "Simulating emergency rollback..."

# Stop new generic relays
pkill -f "torq-relays.*relay" || true

# Start original relays
cargo run --release --bin market_data_relay_original &
cargo run --release --bin signal_relay_original &  
cargo run --release --bin execution_relay_original &

sleep 5

# Verify rollback successful
if pgrep -f "market_data_relay_original" > /dev/null; then
    echo "✅ Rollback successful - original relays running"
else
    echo "❌ Rollback failed"
    exit 1
fi

# Test with clients
cargo run --release --bin polygon_publisher &
POLYGON_PID=$!

sleep 10

if timeout 30s grep -q "messages forwarded" <(tail -f logs); then
    echo "✅ Rollback validation successful"
else  
    echo "❌ Rollback validation failed"
    exit 1
fi

kill $POLYGON_PID
```

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Side-by-side tests show identical behavior between old and new relays
- [ ] Hot-swap migration completes without client connection loss
- [ ] Production simulation runs for 60+ minutes without errors
- [ ] Rollback procedures complete in <30 seconds
- [ ] All deployment scripts execute successfully
- [ ] Documentation covers all operational procedures

## Risk Mitigation

### Service Interruption Risk
**Mitigation**: Multi-phase deployment testing
- Test with non-production traffic first
- Validate hot-swap procedures multiple times
- Have rollback scripts ready and tested

### Client Compatibility Risk  
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive client testing
- Test with polygon_publisher (primary producer)
- Test with dashboard (primary consumer)
- Test with strategy services (signal consumers)
- Validate identical Protocol V2 message handling

### Monitoring and Observability Risk
**Mitigation**: Preserve all monitoring capabilities
- Same health check endpoints
- Same performance metrics
- Same logging formats and levels
- Test alerting systems work unchanged
