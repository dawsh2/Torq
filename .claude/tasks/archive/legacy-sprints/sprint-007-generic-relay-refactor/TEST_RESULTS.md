# Sprint 007 Test Results: Generic Relay Refactor

**Sprint**: 007-generic-relay-refactor  
**Test Date**: [To be filled when testing begins]  
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING

## Test Overview
This sprint refactors the Torq relay system from 3 duplicated implementations (80% shared code) to a unified Generic + Trait architecture. All tests must validate **identical behavior** and **performance preservation**.

## Critical Test Requirements

### 1. Performance Preservation ⚠️ **MANDATORY**
- [ ] **Throughput**: >1M msg/s construction maintained (baseline: 1,097,624 msg/s)
- [ ] **Parsing**: >1.6M msg/s parsing maintained (baseline: 1,643,779 msg/s)  
- [ ] **Latency**: <35μs forwarding per message maintained
- [ ] **Memory**: 64KB buffer per connection (no increase)
- [ ] **Connections**: 1000+ concurrent connections supported

### 2. Functional Equivalence ⚠️ **MANDATORY**
- [ ] **MarketDataRelay**: Bidirectional forwarding pattern preserved
- [ ] **SignalRelay**: Consumer tracking behavior identical
- [ ] **ExecutionRelay**: Consumer tracking behavior identical
- [ ] **Socket paths**: All paths unchanged (`/tmp/torq/*.sock`)
- [ ] **Protocol V2**: TLV message handling identical
- [ ] **Domain separation**: TLV type ranges respected (1-19, 20-39, 40-79)

### 3. Zero-Downtime Migration ⚠️ **MANDATORY**
- [ ] **Hot swap**: Relays replaceable without client disconnection
- [ ] **Client compatibility**: polygon_publisher, dashboard connections work unchanged
- [ ] **Rollback capability**: Emergency revert to original implementations tested
