## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

#### Performance Regression (Risk: High)
- **Mitigation**: Continuous benchmarking during development
- **Contingency**: Rollback to relay system if performance drops >5%
- **Success Criteria**: ≥1M msg/s construction, ≥1.6M msg/s parsing

#### Message Loss During Migration (Risk: Medium)
- **Mitigation**: Blue-green deployment with message replay capability  
- **Contingency**: Parallel operation of relay and broker during transition
- **Success Criteria**: Zero message loss validated by end-to-end tests

#### Integration Complexity (Risk: Medium)
- **Mitigation**: Incremental migration service-by-service
- **Contingency**: Extended testing period if integration issues arise
- **Success Criteria**: All services connect and communicate correctly

### Medium-Risk Areas

#### Configuration Management (Risk: Medium)
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple configurations, add complexity gradually
- **Contingency**: Hard-coded configurations if TOML parsing issues

#### Transport Layer Reliability (Risk: Medium) 
- **Mitigation**: Extensive connection failure testing
- **Contingency**: Fall back to TCP if unix socket issues arise

#### Codec Consolidation Bugs (Risk: Medium)
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive validation against existing relay parsing
- **Contingency**: Keep compatibility layer longer if issues found

### Low-Risk Areas
- Topic routing logic (well-understood pattern)
- Service configuration updates (straightforward changes)
- Documentation updates (non-blocking)
