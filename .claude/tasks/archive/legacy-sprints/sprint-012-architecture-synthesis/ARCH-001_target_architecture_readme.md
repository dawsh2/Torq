# ARCH-001: Target Architecture README - The North Star Document

## 🔴 CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS

### 0. 📋 MARK AS IN-PROGRESS IMMEDIATELY
**⚠️ FIRST ACTION: Change status when you start work!**
```yaml
# Edit the YAML frontmatter above:
status: TODO → status: IN_PROGRESS

# This makes the kanban board show you're working on it!
```

### 1. Git Branch Safety
```bash
# BEFORE STARTING - VERIFY YOU'RE NOT ON MAIN:
git branch --show-current

# If you see "main", IMMEDIATELY run:
git worktree add -b feat/architecture-synthesis-readme

# NEVER commit directly to main!
```

### 2. 🧪 DOCUMENTATION-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT MANDATORY
**⚠️ This is a documentation sprint - write docs FIRST, validate with team!**
```bash
# WORKFLOW: DRAFT → REVIEW → REFINE → VALIDATE
# 1. Write draft documentation
# 2. Review with team/stakeholders  
# 3. Refine based on feedback
# 4. Validate against actual codebase
```

## Status
**Status**: TODO (⚠️ CHANGE TO IN_PROGRESS WHEN YOU START!)
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Branch**: `feat/architecture-synthesis-readme`
**Estimated**: 4 hours

## Problem Statement
Torq currently lacks a coherent, single-source-of-truth architectural overview. Developers (both existing and new) struggle to understand how the various sprint outcomes fit together into a unified system design. There's no "north star" document explaining the three-layer architecture philosophy or how components interact.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Root README.md serves as definitive architectural overview
- [ ] Three-layer philosophy (Data/Rules/Behavior) clearly explained with examples
- [ ] Component breakdown shows clear responsibilities for libs/, network/, services_v2/, relays/
- [ ] Quick start section using manage.sh for immediate developer productivity
- [ ] Architecture diagrams (mermaid) show system structure and data flow
- [ ] Design principles and constraints documented
- [ ] Links to detailed documentation for deeper dives
- [ ] New developer can understand system in <30 minutes
- [ ] All architectural vocabulary used consistently

## Technical Approach
### Files to Create/Modify
- `README.md` (root) - Main architectural overview document
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Detailed architecture guide
- `docs/diagrams/` - Directory for mermaid diagrams
- Update existing documentation links to point to new structure

### Implementation Steps - Documentation-First Approach

1. **DRAFT**: Create comprehensive README.md structure
   ```bash
   # Start with the key sections
   cat > README.md << 'EOF'
   # Torq V2: System Architecture
   
   ## Core Philosophy
   [Three-layer explanation]
   
   ## Quick Start  
   [Using manage.sh commands]
   
   ## Component Overview
   [Directory structure + responsibilities]
   
   ## Architecture
   [Visual diagrams and flow]
   
   ## Development
   [Common workflows]
   EOF
   ```

2. **REVIEW**: Validate against actual codebase structure
   ```bash
   # Ensure documentation matches reality
   find . -type d -name "libs" -o -name "services_v2" -o -name "relays" | head -10
   ls -la scripts/manage.sh  # Verify control script exists
   ```

3. **REFINE**: Add mermaid diagrams for visual clarity
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
       subgraph "Data Layer"
           Types[libs/types<br/>TradeTLV, PoolInfo]
           Codec[libs/codec<br/>Protocol Rules]
       end
       
       subgraph "Behavior Layer"  
           Adapters[services_v2/adapters]
           Relays[relays/]
       end
       
       Adapters --> Types
       Relays --> Codec
   ```

4. **VALIDATE**: Test with new developer perspective

## Architecture Content Structure

### Root README.md Template
```markdown
# Torq V2: High-Performance Trading System

> Built on clean three-layer architecture for scalability and maintainability

## 🏗️ Core Philosophy

The system separates concerns across three distinct layers:

1. **The Data (`libs/types`)**: Pure data structures that represent system concepts
   - `TradeTLV`, `ArbitrageOpportunity`, `PoolInfo` 
   - System's "vocabulary" - what we talk about

2. **The Rules (`libs/codec`)**: Protocol logic that defines communication
   - Parsing, validation, construction of messages
   - System's "grammar" - how we communicate

3. **The Behavior**: Active components that perform work using Data + Rules
   - Services, Relays, Network transport
   - System's "actions" - what we do

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Start entire Torq system
./scripts/manage.sh up

# Check what's running
./scripts/manage.sh status  

# Stream all service logs
./scripts/manage.sh logs

# Stop everything cleanly
./scripts/manage.sh down
```

### Component Responsibilities

| Component | Purpose | Dependencies | Examples |
|-----------|---------|--------------|----------|
| **libs/types** | Define system vocabulary | None (pure data) | `TradeTLV`, `PoolInfo`, `ArbitrageSignal` |
| **libs/codec** | Protocol rules & validation | libs/types | TLV parsing, message building |
| **network/** | Byte transport (Mycelium) | None | Unix sockets, message passing |
| **services_v2/adapters** | External data ingestion | types + codec | Polygon collector, Uniswap adapter |
| **services_v2/strategies** | Trading logic | types + codec | Flash arbitrage, signal processing |
| **relays/** | Message distribution hubs | types + codec + network | Market data relay, signal relay |
| **scripts/** | System lifecycle | All components | Startup, shutdown, monitoring |

## 📊 Architecture Flow

graph LR
    subgraph "External"
        Polygon[Polygon Network]
        Uniswap[Uniswap V3]
    end
    
    subgraph "Torq V2"
        subgraph "Data Ingestion"
            PA[Polygon Adapter]
            UA[Uniswap Adapter]

        subgraph "Message Distribution"
            MDR[Market Data Relay]
            SR[Signal Relay]
        end
        
        subgraph "Processing"
            FA[Flash Arbitrage]
            Dashboard[Dashboard]
        end

```

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Adding New Features
1. **Define data structures** in `libs/types/`
2. **Add protocol rules** in `libs/codec/` if needed
3. **Implement behavior** in appropriate service/relay
4. **Test end-to-end** using unified test framework

### Common Tasks
- **Adding new exchange**: Create adapter in `services_v2/adapters/`
- **New trading strategy**: Implement in `services_v2/strategies/`
- **Protocol changes**: Update `libs/codec/`
- **System monitoring**: Extend `scripts/lib/status.sh`

## 📖 Documentation

- [Detailed Architecture Guide](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Developer Onboarding](docs/DEVELOPER_ONBOARDING.md)  
- [Sprint Synthesis](docs/SPRINT_SYNTHESIS.md)
- [Migration Roadmap](docs/MIGRATION_ROADMAP.md)
- [Architecture Decisions](docs/adr/)

## 🎯 Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Data, Rules, and Behavior are clearly separated
2. **Dependency Direction**: Behavior depends on Rules, Rules depend on Data
3. **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
4. **Testability**: Clean architecture enables comprehensive testing
5. **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries make changes predictable
6. **Performance**: Zero-copy operations where possible, <35μs hot paths

## 📈 Performance Targets

- **Message Processing**: >1M msg/s construction, >1.6M msg/s parsing
- **Latency**: <35μs for hot path operations
- **Startup Time**: <30 seconds for full system via `manage.sh up`
- **Memory Usage**: <50MB per service
- **Precision**: Zero loss (native token decimals preserved)
