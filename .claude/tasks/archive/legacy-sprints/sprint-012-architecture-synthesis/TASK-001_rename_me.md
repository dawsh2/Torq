# TASK-001: [Copy This Template - Don't Edit Directly]

## üî¥ THIS IS A TEMPLATE - COPY TO CREATE REAL TASKS

**‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY!**

This is a template file for creating new tasks in this sprint. To create a real task:

```bash
# Copy this template
cp TASK-001_rename_me.md ARCH-002_sprint_synthesis_document.md

# Edit the copied file with real task details
vim ARCH-002_sprint_synthesis_document.md
```

## Template Usage
1. **Copy the template**: `cp TASK-001_rename_me.md ARCH-XXX_your_task.md`
2. **Edit the copy**: Update task details, acceptance criteria, implementation steps
3. **Leave template**: Keep this `rename_me.md` file for future use

## Why This Template Exists
- Ensures consistent task format across all sprints
- Provides boilerplate for YAML frontmatter and documentation workflow
- Supports rapid task creation by copying vs writing from scratch
- task-manager.sh detects templates vs real tasks automatically

## Architecture Sprint Context
This is Sprint 012: Architecture Synthesis - the culmination sprint that depends on ALL other major sprints being complete. This sprint creates documentation that synthesizes all previous work into a coherent "north star" architecture.

## Next Tasks to Create
See SPRINT_PLAN.md for the tasks that need to be created:
- ARCH-001: Target Architecture README ‚úÖ (already created)
- ARCH-002: Sprint Synthesis Document
- ARCH-003: System Architecture Diagrams  
- ARCH-004: Developer Onboarding Guide
- ARCH-005: Gap Analysis & Migration Plan
- ARCH-006: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Copy this template for each remaining task and customize as needed.

## Special Note for Architecture Tasks
Unlike implementation tasks, these are **documentation-focused**:
- Use "Documentation-Driven Development" approach
- Write drafts, get team review, refine based on feedback
- Validate documentation against actual codebase
- Focus on clarity and comprehensiveness for new developers
