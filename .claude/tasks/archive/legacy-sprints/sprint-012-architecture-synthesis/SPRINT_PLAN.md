# Sprint 012: Architecture Synthesis & North Star Documentation
*Sprint Duration: 3-4 days*
*Objective: Create coherent target architecture documentation that synthesizes all sprint outcomes into a clear "north star"*

## Mission Statement
Synthesize the outcomes of all major refactoring sprints (protocol-to-codec migration, generic relay refactor, adapter cleanup, control script) into a single, coherent target architecture. Create comprehensive documentation that serves as the definitive "north star" for project structure, making the system's design philosophy crystal clear for all developers.

## Core Problems Being Solved
1. **Architecture Fragmentation**: Individual sprints have improved components but overall system design is unclear
2. **Missing Big Picture**: No single document explains how all pieces fit together  
3. **Developer Onboarding**: New contributors lack a clear mental model of the system
4. **Design Drift**: Without clear target architecture, future changes may deviate from intended design
5. **Sprint Alignment**: Ongoing sprints need unified direction toward common architectural vision
6. **Legacy Confusion**: Mixed old/new patterns create cognitive overhead

## Target Architecture Vision

### Three-Layer Philosophy
1. **The Data (`libs/types`)**: Pure data structures - the system's "vocabulary"
2. **The Rules (`libs/codec`)**: Protocol logic - the system's "grammar"  
3. **The Behavior (Services/Relays/Network)**: Active components that use types+codec

## Implementation Examples

### README.md Structure (Root)
```markdown
# Torq V2: System Architecture

High-performance cryptocurrency trading system built on clean three-layer architecture.

## Core Philosophy

The system separates concerns across three distinct layers:

1. **The Data (`libs/types`)**: Pure data structures - system vocabulary
2. **The Rules (`libs/codec`)**: Protocol logic - system grammar  
3. **The Behavior**: Active components using types+codec

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start entire system
./scripts/manage.sh up

# Check status  
./scripts/manage.sh status

# View logs
./scripts/manage.sh logs

# Stop system
./scripts/manage.sh down
```

## Component Overview

- **`libs/`**: Shared foundation (types, codec, utilities)
- **`network/`**: Mycelium transport layer (byte movement)
- **`services_v2/`**: Business logic (adapters, strategies, dashboard)
- **`relays/`**: Message-passing hubs (generic engine + domain logic)
- **`scripts/`**: System management (unified control interface)

See [Architecture Guide](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed design.
```
