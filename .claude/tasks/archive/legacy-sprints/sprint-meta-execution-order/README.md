# Sprint Meta: Execution Order Coordination

This is a **meta sprint** owned and operated by the Scrum Leader. It is NOT a development sprint and should NOT be delegated to development teams.

## Purpose

Ensure all refactoring sprints execute in the correct dependency order to minimize friction, rework, and technical debt.

## Key Files

- `SPRINT_PLAN.md` - Master execution order and dependency graph
- `EXECUTION_TRACKER.md` - Real-time tracking of sprint progress and phase gates

## Current Status

- **Active Sprint**: 013 (Architecture Audit) 
- **Next Sprint**: 010 (Codec Separation)
- **Blocked Count**: 8 sprints waiting on dependencies

## The Critical Path

```
Sprint 013 (now) → Sprint 010 → Sprint 006 → Sprint 007 → Sprint 011 → Sprint 009 → Sprint 014 → Sprint 005/004 → Sprint 012
```

**NO DEVIATIONS FROM THIS PATH**

## Why This Matters

Previous attempts to parallelize or reorder sprints have caused:
- Significant rework when foundations changed
- Circular dependencies 
- Incomplete implementations
- Technical debt accumulation

This meta sprint prevents these issues through strict execution order enforcement.

## Scrum Leader Responsibilities

1. **Daily**: Check no teams are working on blocked sprints
2. **Weekly**: Update execution tracker with progress
3. **Sprint Transitions**: Validate dependencies before unblocking
4. **Communication**: Keep all teams aware of current and next sprints

## For Development Teams

- **Current Focus**: Sprint 013 only
- **Do NOT Start**: Any sprint marked BLOCKED in the tracker
- **Questions**: Ask scrum leader before beginning any new work

Remember: The fastest way forward is to follow the plan exactly.
