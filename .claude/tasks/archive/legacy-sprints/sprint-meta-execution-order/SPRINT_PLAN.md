# Sprint Meta: Execution Order Coordination

**Sprint Type**: Meta/Coordination
**Owner**: Scrum Leader (NOT delegatable)
**Purpose**: Ensure sprints are executed in the correct dependency order to minimize friction and rework

## Executive Summary

This meta sprint tracks the proper chronological execution of all system refactoring sprints. Previous attempts to parallelize or execute out of order have caused significant friction. This sprint ensures we follow the critical path.

## Sprint Execution Phases

### Phase 1: Foundational Refactoring (Stabilize the Core)
*Must complete before any other phase*

#### 1. Sprint 013: Architecture Audit & Critical Fixes ✅ IN PROGRESS
- **Status**: Currently executing
- **Goal**: Fix current state by completing foundational refactorings
- **Blocks**: Everything else

#### 2. Sprint 010: Codec Separation 
- **Status**: BLOCKED (waiting on Sprint 013)
- **Goal**: Split protocol_v2 into libs/types and libs/codec
- **Critical Path**: YES - Most critical architectural change
- **Blocks**: Sprints 006, 007, 011, 009, 014, 005, 004, 012

#### 3. Sprint 006: Protocol Optimization & Macros
- **Status**: BLOCKED (waiting on Sprint 010)
- **Goal**: Introduce macros for TypedId and TLV definitions
- **Dependency**: Must have separated codec first
- **Blocks**: All subsequent development

#### 4. Sprint 007: Generic Relay Refactor
- **Status**: BLOCKED (waiting on Sprint 010 + 006)
- **Goal**: Clean up relays/ directory using generic/trait pattern
- **Dependency**: Needs new codec and macro system
- **Creates**: Clean pattern for infrastructure

### Phase 2: Operational Stability & Quality
*Requires stable Phase 1 architecture*

#### 5. Sprint 011: Control Script Management
- **Status**: BLOCKED (waiting on Phase 1 completion)
- **Goal**: Create unified manage.sh script
- **Dependency**: Needs stable, refactored components
- **Impact**: Dramatically improves development workflow

#### 6. Sprint 009: Testing Pyramid
- **Status**: BLOCKED (waiting on Phase 1 completion)
- **Goal**: Comprehensive testing strategy
- **Dependency**: Architecture must be stable to avoid test rework
- **Impact**: Quality assurance foundation

### Phase 3: Advanced Architecture & Evolution
*Builds on stable, tested foundation*

#### 7. Sprint 014: MessageSink & Lazy Connections
- **Status**: BLOCKED (waiting on Phase 1 + 2)
- **Goal**: Implement MessageSink trait for flexible messaging
- **Dependency**: Needs stable relays and services
- **Impact**: Next evolution of messaging architecture

#### 8. Sprint 005 & 004: Mycelium MVP & Runtime
- **Status**: BLOCKED (waiting on Phase 1 + 2 + early Phase 3)
- **Goal**: Migration to brokerless, actor-based model
- **Dependency**: Complete system stability required
- **Impact**: Future system evolution

### Phase 4: Finalization

#### 9. Sprint 012: Architecture Synthesis
- **Status**: BLOCKED (waiting on all phases)
- **Goal**: Create final "north star" documentation
- **Dependency**: All technical work must be complete
- **Impact**: Coherent system documentation

## Execution Rules

1. **NO PARALLELIZATION**: Sprints must execute in order within phases
2. **PHASE GATES**: Cannot start next phase until current phase is 100% complete
3. **NO SHORTCUTS**: Each sprint's acceptance criteria must be fully met
4. **VALIDATION**: After each sprint, validate that dependent sprints are unblocked

## Current Action

**NOW**: Complete Sprint 013 (Architecture Audit)
**NEXT**: Begin Sprint 010 (Codec Separation) immediately after 013 completion
**BLOCKED**: All other sprints remain blocked until their dependencies clear

## Monitoring Checklist

Weekly review by Scrum Leader:
- [ ] Current sprint progress
- [ ] Dependency validation
- [ ] No parallel work violating order
- [ ] Teams not starting blocked sprints
- [ ] Clear communication of what's next

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk**: Attempting sprints out of order
**Mitigation**: This meta sprint tracking + daily validation

**Risk**: Incomplete sprint causing cascade issues
**Mitigation**: Strict acceptance criteria enforcement

**Risk**: Team idle while waiting
**Mitigation**: Clear sprint completion targets + prepared sprint kickoffs
