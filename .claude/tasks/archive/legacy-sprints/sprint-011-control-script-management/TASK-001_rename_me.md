# TASK-001: [Copy This Template - Don't Edit Directly]

## üî¥ THIS IS A TEMPLATE - COPY TO CREATE REAL TASKS

**‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY!**

This is a template file for creating new tasks in this sprint. To create a real task:

```bash
# Copy this template
cp TASK-001_rename_me.md CTRL-002_service_startup_engine.md

# Edit the copied file with real task details
vim CTRL-002_service_startup_engine.md
```

## Template Usage
1. **Copy the template**: `cp TASK-001_rename_me.md TASK-XXX_your_task.md`
2. **Edit the copy**: Update task details, acceptance criteria, implementation steps
3. **Leave template**: Keep this `rename_me.md` file for future use

## Why This Template Exists
- Ensures consistent task format across all sprints
- Provides boilerplate for YAML frontmatter and TDD workflow
- Supports rapid task creation by copying vs writing from scratch
- task-manager.sh detects templates vs real tasks automatically

## Next Steps
See SPRINT_PLAN.md for the tasks that need to be created:
- CTRL-001: Main Orchestrator Script ‚úÖ (already created)
- CTRL-002: Service Startup Engine
- CTRL-003: Graceful Shutdown System  
- CTRL-004: Service Status Monitor
- CTRL-005: Unified Log Streaming
- CTRL-006: Legacy Script Migration
- CTRL-007: Directory Structure Setup

Copy this template for each remaining task and customize as needed.
