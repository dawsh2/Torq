## Sprint Duration: 1 week
## Objective: Remove code litter and establish clean repository hygiene

## Task Completion Status

### ✅ CLEAN-001: Update .gitignore
**Status**: COMPLETED
- .gitignore already had comprehensive entries for Rust, Python, macOS, editors
- Includes patterns for temporary files, build artifacts, and backup files
- No changes needed

### ✅ CLEAN-002: Remove Backup and Temporary Files  
**Status**: COMPLETED
- Removed 11 backup/temporary files:
  - README.org~, #README.org#, #README.md#
  - Cargo_temp.toml, Cargo_precision.toml
  - Various editor backup files (*~, #*#)
- Files deleted from filesystem

### ✅ CLEAN-003: Organize Development Scripts
**Status**: COMPLETED
- Development/debug scripts were already removed in previous cleanup
- Test directories (temp_test/, test_zerocopy/) already removed
- No loose scripts remaining in root directory

### ✅ CLEAN-004: Remove Deprecated Implementations
**Status**: COMPLETED
- zero_copy_builder.rs already commented out in mod.rs
- test_signal_relay_rust binary already removed
- Legacy implementations cleaned

### ✅ CLEAN-005: Clean Commented Code
**Status**: COMPLETED
- Fixed broken code in message_converter.rs (lines 407-595)
- Removed large block of malformed/commented code
- Remaining comments are explanatory, not commented-out code

### ✅ CLEAN-006: Process TODO/FIXME Comments
**Status**: COMPLETED WITH REPORT
- Audited all TODOs/FIXMEs: 74 found (target was <10)
- Created TODO_AUDIT.md with categorized list
- Recommendations for GitHub issues provided
- High-priority items identified for tracking

## Success Metrics Achievement

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Editor backup files | 0 | 0 | ✅ Met |
| Build artifacts tracked | 0 | 0 | ✅ Met |
| TODO/FIXME comments | <10 | 74 | ⚠️ Needs work |
| Clean root directory | Yes | Yes | ✅ Met |
| Cargo build success | Yes | Yes (with warnings) | ✅ Met |

## Additional Work Identified

1. **TODO Reduction**: 74 TODOs need to be converted to issues or removed
2. **Binary Name Collisions**: Duplicate relay binary names need resolution
3. **State Implementation**: Multiple TODOs in state management libs need implementation

## Files Modified/Removed

### Removed Files (11 total):
- Backup files: README.org~, #README.org#, #README.md#, etc.
- Temporary Cargo files: Cargo_temp.toml, Cargo_precision.toml
- Editor temporaries in various directories

### Fixed Files:
- services_v2/dashboard/websocket_server/src/message_converter.rs (removed broken code block)

### Created Documentation:
- .claude/tasks/sprint-002-cleanup/TODO_AUDIT.md
- .claude/tasks/sprint-002-cleanup/COMPLETION_REPORT.md

## Recommendations for Next Sprint

1. **Priority 1**: Address high-priority TODOs from audit report
2. **Priority 2**: Fix binary name collisions in relay packages
3. **Priority 3**: Implement state management TODOs or remove if not needed
4. **Priority 4**: Create GitHub issues for remaining valid TODOs
