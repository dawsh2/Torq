# Post-Review Fixes Completed

## Date: 2025-08-26
## Sprint: 002 - Code Hygiene & Repository Cleanup

## Fixes Applied Based on Code Review

### ✅ 1. Fixed Binary Name Collisions
**Issue**: Duplicate binary names between `torq-relays` and subdirectory packages causing build warnings
**Solution**: 
- Removed 6 duplicate binary source files from `/relays/src/bin/`:
  - `execution_relay.rs`
  - `market_data_relay.rs` 
  - `signal_relay.rs`
  - `enhanced_signal_relay.rs`
  - `fixed_signal_relay.rs`
  - `simple_market_relay.rs`
- These binaries are now properly defined only in their respective subdirectory packages:
  - `/relays/market_data_relay/`
  - `/relays/signal_relay/`
  - `/relays/execution_relay/`
**Result**: Build warnings eliminated, clean compilation

### ✅ 2. Removed Empty State Management Libraries
**Issue**: Placeholder state management libraries with no implementation causing confusion
**Solution**:
- Completely removed directories:
  - `/libs/state/execution/`
  - `/libs/state/portfolio/`
- Updated workspace `Cargo.toml` to remove references:
  - Removed from `members` array
  - Removed from `workspace.dependencies`
**Result**: Cleaner codebase without stub implementations

### ✅ 3. Message Converter Function Already Fixed
**Note**: The `convert_demo_defi_arbitrage_tlv` function issue was already resolved by linter/user modifications. The function now properly returns a deprecated message without referencing non-existent types.

## Build Status
- ✅ `cargo build --release` runs successfully
- ✅ No more binary name collision warnings
- ✅ All workspace members compile correctly

## Remaining Work (Deferred)
As requested, the following items are saved for later investigation:
1. Pool cache snapshot functionality (TODOs at lines 1163, 1183)
2. V3 AMM calculations incomplete (optimal_size.rs TODOs)
3. TLV parsing for venue extraction not implemented

## Files Modified
- Removed files: 8 total (6 binaries + 2 library directories)
- Modified: `Cargo.toml` (workspace configuration)

## Next Steps
The codebase is now cleaner with:
- No duplicate binaries
- No empty placeholder libraries
- Clean compilation without warnings

Ready to proceed with investigating the deferred implementation tasks.
