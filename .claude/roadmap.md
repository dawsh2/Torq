# Torq Development Roadmap
*Last Updated: 2025-08-25*

## 🎯 STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE: Arbitrage Strategy to Production
**Primary Goal**: Complete arbitrage strategy deployment until production-ready and live
**Secondary Goal**: Modularize and downsize codebase through high-quality consolidations

## Current Sprint: Production Arbitrage Deployment

### Phase 1: Core Pipeline Fix (COMPLETED ✅)
- [x] Debug exchange WebSocket connections - Polygon data ingestion working
- [x] Debug relay message flow - TLV messages flowing between components
- [x] Fix arbitrage strategy - receiving data and generating signals
- [x] Fix signal relay - receiving and forwarding strategy signals
- [x] Fix dashboard WebSocket connection - consuming live relay data
- [x] Validate complete flow: Exchange → Polygon → Relay → Arb → Signal → Dashboard
- [x] Dashboard displaying live arbitrage opportunities with accurate data

**Achievement**: Full end-to-end pipeline operational with real-time dashboard visualization

### Phase 2: Protocol V2 Header Fix (COMPLETED ✅)
**Critical magic byte placement issue has been resolved**

#### Protocol Header Restructure
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Move magic byte to position 0 in MessageHeader struct
- [x] Update MessageHeader layout: magic(u32) → metadata(u32) → sequence(u64) → timestamp(u64) → payload_size(u32) → checksum(u32)
- [x] Verify 32-byte total size maintained after restructure
- [x] Update all zerocopy trait implementations for new layout
- [x] Fix checksum calculation offsets for new header structure

**Achievement**: Protocol V2 header structure correctly positions magic byte at bytes 0-3 with proper 32-byte alignment
