//! # Execution Relay Logic
//!
//! Domain-specific logic for the Execution relay that handles TLV types 40-79.
//! This includes trade executions, order management, and execution confirmations.
//!
//! ## Architecture Role
//!
//! Implements the `RelayLogic` trait for the Execution domain, providing:
//! - Domain identification (RelayDomain::Execution)
//! - Socket path configuration  
//! - Security-focused message filtering and validation
//!
//! ```mermaid
//! graph TB
//!     Engine[Execution Engine] -->|Execution TLVs| Socket["/tmp/torq/execution.sock"]
//!     Socket --> Relay["`Relay<ExecutionLogic>`"]
//!     Relay -->|Broadcast| Portfolio[Portfolio Manager]

//!         Path[socket_path() = execution.sock]
//!         Filter[should_forward() = Security Validation]
//!     end

//! ## Message Types Handled
//! - **TLV Types 40-79**: All execution and order management messages
//! - **Security Critical**: Strict validation for financial operations
//! - **Audit Trail**: All messages logged for compliance
//!
//! ## Performance Profile
//! - **Security First**: Additional validation may impact latency
//! - **Execution Integrity**: Emphasis on correctness over pure speed  
//! - **Compliance Ready**: Designed for regulatory requirements

/// Handles all execution messages (TLV types 40-79) with emphasis on security and integrity.

///
/// ## Design Philosophy
/// - **Security First**: Strict validation of execution messages
/// - **Audit Compliance**: Detailed logging for regulatory requirements
/// - **Integrity Checks**: Additional validation for financial operations
/// - **Permission Control**: Future support for execution authorization
///
/// ## Socket Configuration
/// Uses `/tmp/torq/execution.sock` for Unix socket communication.
/// This path must be consistent with execution engines and consumers.
