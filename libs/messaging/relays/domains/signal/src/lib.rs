//! # Signal Relay Logic
//!
//! Domain-specific logic for the Signal relay that handles TLV types 20-39.
//! This includes arbitrage signals, strategy outputs, and trading recommendations.
//!
//! ## Architecture Role
//!
//! Implements the `RelayLogic` trait for the Signal domain, providing:
//! - Domain identification (RelayDomain::Signal)
//! - Socket path configuration
//! - Optional signal-specific message filtering
//!
//! ```mermaid

//!     Strategy[Flash Arbitrage Strategy] -->|Signal TLVs| Socket["/tmp/torq/signals.sock"]

//!         Filter[should_forward() = TLV 20-39]
//!     end

//! ## Message Types Handled
//! - **TLV Types 20-39**: All signal and strategy messages
//! - **Medium Volume**: Optimized for strategy-generated signals
//! - **Quality Focus**: Emphasis on signal integrity and validation
//!
//! ## Performance Profile
//! - **Domain Validation**: Strict adherence to Signal TLV range (20-39)
//! - **Selective Distribution**: Only valid signals forwarded
//! - **Balanced Performance**: Good throughput with signal validation

/// Signal relay logic implementation
///
/// Handles all signal messages (TLV types 20-39) with emphasis on signal integrity.
/// May include additional validation beyond basic domain checking in the future.
///
/// ## Design Philosophy
/// - **Signal Integrity**: Ensure only valid signals are distributed
/// - **Strategy Support**: Optimized for strategy-generated messages
/// - **Future Extensibility**: Designed for additional signal validation
///
/// ## Socket Configuration
/// Uses `/tmp/torq/signals.sock` for Unix socket communication.
/// This path must be consistent with signal producers and consumers.

    /// - Signal quality checks

        // - Validate signal metadata
        // - Apply rate limiting per strategy
